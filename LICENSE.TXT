2. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

 a. Distributable Code.
  The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in
  programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.
  (For this Section the term "distribution" also means deployment of
  your programs for third parties to access over the Internet.)

  i. Right to Use and Distribute.
   The code and text files listed below are “Distributable Code.”

   · REDIST.TXT Files.
     You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed on
     the REDIST list located at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313603.
   · Sample Code
     You may modify, copy and distribute the source and object code form
     of code marked as “sample.”
   · Third Party Distribution.
     You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute
     the Distributable Code as part of those programs.

  ii. Distribution Requirements.
   For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must

   · add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
   · for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib,
     distribute only the results of running such Distributable Code
     through a linker with your program;
   · distribute Distributable Code included in a setup program only as
     part of that setup program without modification;
   · require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
     protect it at least as much as this agreement;
   · display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
   · indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
     including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of
     your programs.

  iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not

   · alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the
     Distributable Code;
   · use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way
     that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
   · distribute Distributable Code to run on a platform other than
     Microsoft operating systems, run-time technologies, or application
     platforms;
   · include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
     programs; or
   · modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
     that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License.
     An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
     modification or distribution, that
     · the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
     · others have the right to modify it.
