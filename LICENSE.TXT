MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ REDISTRIBUTABLE FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2013

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based
on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They
apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you
received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
  *  updates,
  *  supplements,
  *  Internet-based services, and
  *  support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those
terms apply.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM,
DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.
1.  INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. You may install and use any number of copies
    of the software on your devices.
2.  SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
    gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
    rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
    limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this
    agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in
    the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
    *  disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any third
       party without Microsoft’s prior written approval;
    *  work around any technical limitations in the software;
    *  reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only
       to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
       limitation;
    *  make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or
       allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
    *  publish the software for others to copy;
    *  rent, lease or lend the software;
    *  transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
    *  use the software for commercial software hosting services.
3.  BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it
    only to reinstall the software.
4.  DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or
    internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal,
    reference purposes.
5.  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws
    and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export
    laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include
    restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional
    information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
6.  SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide
    support services for it.
7.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
    Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
    agreement for the software and support services.
8.  APPLICABLE LAW.
    a.  United States. If you acquired the software in the United States,
        Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
        applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
        principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other
        claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
        competition laws, and in tort.
    b.  Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other
        country, the laws of that country apply.
9.  LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have
    other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
    respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement
    does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of
    your country do not permit it to do so.
10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE
    RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
    CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES
    UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER
    LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU
    CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
    SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
    This limitation applies to
    *  anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
       third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
    *  claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
       condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
       permitted by applicable law.
    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
    possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply
    to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    incidental, consequential or other damages.
