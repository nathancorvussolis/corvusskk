DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.
 The software contains code that you may distribute in applications you

  The code and text files listed below are "Distributable Code".
  · Distributable List.
    You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed on the

    code marked as "sample", "template", "simple styles" and "sketch styles".
  · Third Party Distribution.
    You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute
    the Distributable Code as part of those applications.

 b. Distribution Requirements.
  For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must:
  · add significant primary functionality to it in your applications; and
  · require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
    protect the Distributable Code at least as much as this agreement.

 c. Distribution Restrictions.
  You may not:
  · use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a way that
    suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or
  · modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any
    part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An "Excluded License"
    is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution
	of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
